# DICOM Parsing App

An experiment to parse [DICOM](https://www.dicomstandard.org/about) and learn more about it's [Multipart](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part18/sect_8.7.html) content type and how [dcmjs](https://github.com/dcmjs-org/dcmjs) uses an [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) to make DICOM post requests.

You can copy and paste Int32 array from your clipboard into the input. See the included sample.json for an example.
